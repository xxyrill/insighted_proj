However, due to the fast pace, we weren't able to keep up and fully grasp the lessons. This was exacerbated by the fact that during some discussions, he assumed we already knew how to solve the problems immediately. In reality, some students, particularly slow learners, struggled to keep up. It would be beneficial if he attempted to adjust to the students' learning pace. With that, we should prioritize understanding the material rather than rushing through lessons without a clear grasp of the content.","The pace is so fast that we have to attend classes for 2-3 hours a day, four days a week. Sometimes, we have no choice but to move on to the next lesson without a full understanding, leading students to self-study. Our quizzes are particularly challenging, involving complex problems in a fill-in-the-blank format. It would greatly benefit us if quizzes allowed at least 2 attempts, providing students with an opportunity to enhance their scores, especially considering that our instructor rarely allows retakes unless for special reasons. Accounting is difficult, and this learning strategy makes it even more challenging for students who are eager to learn."

Very accommodating and present to students concerns. I like how Sir carefully evaluates each and every activities. His way of teaching is great, but too fast phased leading to students only grasping what they can remember. Only a few students can keep up with the phase and the rest are just trying their best to catch up even if it means that they are learning only on surface level. However, teacher is very considerate when needed and always gives chance to struggling to students in order for them to not repeat the course.","Course itself is very tiring, fast and hard to grasp. I as a student, am aware that college isn't supposed to be easy and lessons are not supposed to be spoonfed anymore. But how can students keep up when we need to study for at least 5 chapters in a month while also dealing with other courses that are time demanding. Of course advance study is an option and discipline is also needed but it isn't enough to dive deeper into the topic. The oral recitation scares and pressures most of the students leading for them to choose asynchronous or synchronous sessions. The quizzes only gives you one attempt. The course lacks learning evaluation which means that proceeding to the next topic even though the most of the class are still confused by the last topic yet they have no choice but to settle with surface knowledge in order to catch up."

This was exacerbated by the fact that during some discussions, he assumed we already knew how to solve the problems immediately. In reality, some students, particularly slow learners, struggled to keep up. It would be beneficial if he attempted to adjust to the students' learning pace. With that, we should prioritize understanding the material rather than rushing through lessons without a clear grasp of the content.","The pace is so fast that we have to attend classes for 2-3 hours a day, four days a week. Sometimes, we have no choice but to move on to the next lesson without a full understanding, leading students to self-study. Our quizzes are particularly challenging, involving complex problems in a fill-in-the-blank format. It would greatly benefit us if quizzes allowed at least 2 attempts, providing students with an opportunity to enhance their scores, especially considering that our instructor rarely allows retakes unless for special reasons. Accounting is difficult, and this learning strategy makes it even more challenging for students who are eager to learn."
